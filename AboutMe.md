Jesus is my whole world, and His love has radically changed my life! If you want to know Him or don't have a personal relationship with Him now - please reach out to me at 417 569 2988!

I love the outdoors - specifically backpacking! I did Boy Scouts for years and eventually made it to Eagle all the while having great backpacking adventures. My top experiences are:

I also love the St. Louis Blues and hockey in general!
